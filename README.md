# Office Cube Hero Extreme Edition DX XD

In this game, you are a super hero with a boring office job alter ego. You need to keep the citizens of Cube City safe while keeping up-to-date on your paperwork.

On the right side of your screen is your office - you need to stamp paperwork.

On the left side of the screen is the view out your window. Yellow civilians walk back and forth, but red robbers will try to kill them! Click the window to fly out, move around with WASD, and left click to attack nearby robbers. Once you've beaten up the active robbers, fly onto your window to get back into the building.

If civilians die, you lose points. You gain points by beating up robbers and stamping paperwork.
